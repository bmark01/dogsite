* Running the stairs:
Start at the top of the stairs. Ask Watson to do any behavior he knows, like sit, down, shake, spin, etc. Click/verbally mark when they do it, then toss a treat to the bottom of the steps. Encourage him to go get it, then rinse and repeat. This is an easy way to physically tire him quickly.
